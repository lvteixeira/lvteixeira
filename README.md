Hello, 
My name is Leo and I"m from Brazil. I'm an 24 years old syseng, computer science student.
I've been programming back end systems in Python, Java and NodeJS.

Lately I'm seeking to improve front end skills by studying React and styling fancy pages with TailwindCSS using DaisyUI.

On free time I like to read non technical books, make some coffee and seize the day outside.
