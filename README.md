Hello, 
My name is Leo and I"m from Brazil. I'm an 25 years old fullstack web developer, computer science student.
I've been programming back end systems in Java, NodeJS, Python and also fancy UI apps in React.

Lately I'm seeking to improve software engineering skills for writing better code no matter the paradigm.

On free time I like to read non technical books, listen to good music, make some coffee and seize the day outside.
